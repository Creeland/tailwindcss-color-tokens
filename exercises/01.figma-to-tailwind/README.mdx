# Figma to Tailwind CSS

This first chapter is about exploring the Figma file.

As you can see, colors are first defined as "raw" color palette values â€” but there is an extra layer of abstraction that defines **semantic color tokens**.

Those design tokens are scoped to **background**, **text** and **border** colors.

## Color Variables in Figma

The design leverages Figma's variables to power the UI.

### Raw color tokens

First, "raw" color accessors are mapped to the color values directly:

<img
	src="/images/raw-color-tokens.png"
	alt="screenshot of Figma's variables panel, showing the raw color tokens"
/>

### Semantic color tokens

Then, those raw color values are aliased to semantic color tokens:

<img
	src="/images/semantic-color-tokens.png"
	alt="screenshot of Figma's variables panel, showing the semantic color tokens"
/>

### Usage in the design

The design is consuming these semantic tokens to compose the UI:

<img
	src="/images/color-tokens-usage.png"
	alt="screenshot of Figma's side panel, showing the use of semantic color tokens"
/>

## Figma to Taiwind Conversion

This exercise is about converting the Figma design to a Tailwind CSS project.
