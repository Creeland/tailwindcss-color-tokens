# Tailwind CSS Color Tokens ðŸŽ¨

In this workshop, we're going to define **semantic color tokens** in Tailwind CSS, to adhere to a convention set in a Figma design File.

We'll cover both Tailwind CSS v3 and v4 approaches ðŸ”¥

## The Figma File

## Semantic Design Tokens

As you can see in the Figma file, colors are first defined as "raw" color palette values â€” but there is an extra layer of abstraction that defines **semantic color tokens**.

Those design tokens are scoped to **background**, **text** and **border** colors.

### Multi-Theme Support

The idea behind this layer of design token abstraction: UI elements should not be directly connected to a specific color value â€”Â but instead us an aliased reference token.

This unlocks the ability to change an entire design system by changing the color tokens,Â opening doors to advanced theming strategies.

### Unified Design Language

The semantic naming convention of these tokens also allows teams to better communicate about the design system, and to create a shared design language.

Here's a visual representation of this design token layer, as presented on the [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/tokens/design-tokens)'s Design Tokens documentation page:
