As mentioned already, the Figma design implements a layer of abstraction — semantic design tokens — on top of the raw color values:

<img
	src="/images/semantic-color-tokens.png"
	alt="screenshot of Figma's variables panel showing semantic color design tokens"
/>

## Tailwind CSS Implementation

In this exercise, we'll implement these semantic design tokens in our Tailwind CSS project.
