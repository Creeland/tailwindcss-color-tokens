# Custom colors in UI

## 1. Add custom theme colors

Start by extending the Tailwind theme with the raw color tokens.

You can do this in the <InlineFile file="tailwind.config.ts" /> file.

```ts
export default {
	theme: {
		extend: {
			colors: {
				// Add the colors here...
			},
		},
	},
}
```

There should be 12 new colors added to the theme:

- `highlight`
- `accent`
- `grey-0`
- `grey-5`
- `grey-10`
- `grey-20`
- `grey-30`
- `grey-40`
- `grey-50`
- `grey-60`
- `grey-70`
- `grey-80`
- `grey-90`
- `grey-100`

## 2. Replace the colors in the UI

Update the UI to use the color tokens to match the design.

Remember, we'll change to semantic design tookens later — but let's get the UI right first with these new colors in place.
