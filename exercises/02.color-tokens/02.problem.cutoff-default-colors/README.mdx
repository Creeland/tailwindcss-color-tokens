# Cutoff Default Colors

By extending the theme, we still hace access to all the default colors.

While that's very useful for prototyping, in this case we don't want devlopers to start using `zinc` instead our custom `grey`, or `indigo` instead of our `accent`.

Make sure the only colors available in the theme are the custom ones you've added.
